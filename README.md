# Background

Better Transportation infrastructure in developing countries improves the efficiency and speed of the transfer of goods and people while reducing the unit cost which favors growth of the country.  Developing countries such as Kenya suffer from poor infrastructure, particularly highway infrastructure, and institutional finance problems which prevent roadway infrastructure from being significantly improved in a short time period.

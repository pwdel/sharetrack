/* -----------------------------------------------------------
This example shows some clever ways to use the accelerometer
and report that data efficiently. It also includes the transmit
mode and battery reading functions from the previous example.

By default, it publishes only when there's a significant bump
against it AND there's been at least 10 minutes since the last
publish. NOTE: the first publish will only happen after the
device has been on for at least this long!
